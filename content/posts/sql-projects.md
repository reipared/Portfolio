**Welcome!**

Here you'll find SQL projects demonstrating my ability to query, clean, and analyze data efficiently. Each project includes:

- The dataset and database schema used.
- Key queries and techniques applied.
- Insights and results derived from the analysis.

Explore these projects to see how I utilize SQL for data manipulation and decision-making.
