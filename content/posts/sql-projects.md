**Welcome!**

Here you'll find SQL projects demonstrating my ability to query, clean, and analyze data efficiently. Each project includes:

- The dataset and database schema used.
- Key queries and techniques applied.
- Insights and results derived from the analysis.

Explore these projects to see how I utilize SQL for data manipulation and decision-making.

## [**Sales Performance Analysis**](https://github.com/reipared/SQL_Projects/tree/main/Sales_Performance)

This project involves analyzing sales data using SQL to extract valuable business insights. Through complex queries, joins, and aggregate functions, I uncover trends in revenue, customer behavior, and product performance. The findings help businesses optimize their sales strategies based on data-driven decisions.
