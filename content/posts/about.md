## Hi, I’m Reinaldo 👋

I’m a **bilingual Data Analyst** with a strong background in **email marketing and IT**, and over **10 years of experience** working across technical and business-focused roles. My work sits at the intersection of **data, systems, and marketing performance**.

In recent years, I’ve focused on **analytics-driven email marketing**, where I’ve supported **end-to-end campaign execution, performance reporting, and optimization** across multiple brands. By combining **structured data analysis, segmentation, and A/B testing**, I helped drive a **72% year-over-year increase in email-driven revenue**, followed by an additional **23% growth** through sustained optimization and automation.

I’m especially comfortable working with **recurring performance data**, including **weekly, monthly, and yearly reporting, KPI tracking**, and turning **raw datasets into clear, actionable insights**. My background in IT gives me a strong foundation in **systems, data reliability, and problem-solving**, which carries through into how I approach analytics work.

## 🔹My Expertise

✅ **Data Analysis & Visualization** → Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), R, Power BI, Tableau.

✅ **Databases & SQL** → PostgreSQL, MySQL

✅ **Business & Marketing Analytics** → Customer insights, A/B testing, KPI tracking

## 🚀 Why Data Analytics?

I've always been passionate about **understanding patterns, making data-driven decisions, and solving business problems**.

After working in IT and digital marketing, I realized that **data is the key to success**, and now I focus on helping businesses make the most of their data.
