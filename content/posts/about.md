## Hi, I’m Reinaldo 👋

I’m a **bilingual Data Analyst** with a strong background in **email marketing and IT**, and over **10 years of experience** working across technical and business-focused roles. My work sits at the intersection of **data, systems, and marketing performance**.

In recent years, I’ve focused on **analytics-driven email marketing**, where I’ve supported **end-to-end campaign execution, performance reporting, and optimization** across multiple brands. By combining **structured data analysis, segmentation, and A/B testing**, I helped drive a **72% year-over-year increase in email-driven revenue**, followed by an additional **23% growth** through sustained optimization and automation.

I’m especially comfortable working with **recurring performance data**, including **weekly, monthly, and yearly reporting, KPI tracking**, and turning **raw datasets into clear, actionable insights**. My background in IT gives me a strong foundation in **systems, data reliability, and problem-solving**, which carries through into how I approach analytics work.

## 🔹What I Work With

✅ **Data analysis & reporting** using Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau

✅ **Marketing and business analytics**, including KPI tracking, cohort analysis, and YoY comparisons

✅ **Email performance analysis**, segmentation, automation, and experimentation

✅ **Data cleaning and transformation** for structured performance tracking

✅ **Clear communication of insights** to technical and non-technical stakeholders

## 🚀 Background

Before moving fully into analytics and marketing data, I spent several years in **IT system administration and support**. That experience shaped how I think about **data quality, infrastructure, and operational efficiency**, and allows me to collaborate effectively with technical teams.

Today, I focus on **using data to measure impact, improve performance, and support better decision-making**, particularly in **marketing and customer-focused environments**.
