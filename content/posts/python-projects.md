**Welcome!**

Here you'll find Python projects that cover various aspects of data analysis, automation, and visualization. Each project includes:

- The dataset and data sources used.
- The methodology applied.
- Key insights and outcomes.

Feel free to explore the projects and see how I use Python to extract meaningful insights and automate data workflows.

## [**Bookstore Web Scraping**](https://github.com/reipared/Bookstore_Web_Scraping_with_Python)

This project is a web scraper for [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com), an online bookstore for testing web scraping scripts. The scraper downloads HTML pages from the site and extracts product information, such as book titles, prices, and URLs saving the data into a csv file.

## [**BMI Calcualtor**](https://github.com/reipared/bmi_calculator)

This project calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input.
