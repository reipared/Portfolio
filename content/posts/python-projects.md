**Welcome!**

Here you'll find Python projects that cover various aspects of data analysis, automation, and visualization. Each project includes:

- The dataset and data sources used.
- The methodology applied.
- Key insights and outcomes.

Feel free to explore the projects and see how I use Python to extract meaningful insights and automate data workflows.

## **Bookstore Web Scraping**

This project is a web scraper for [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com), an online bookstore for testing web scraping scripts. The scraper downloads HTML pages from the site and extracts product information, such as book titles, prices, and URLs saving the data into a csv file.
